[ ] Speed up array searches for 'free' jobs/queue-entries with a bitset of open entries?
[ ] Replace as much locking as possible with atomic exchanges (incr/decr and pointer substitutions)
[ ] Add a way to queue jobs (or maybe groups?) for a specific thread, so that app can prioritize/spread according to need/job
[ ] Add a way to indicate a job should be run many times, but each time with a new input/output pair (callback to get?)
